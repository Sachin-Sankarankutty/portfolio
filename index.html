      <p>
      I am a Linux Administrator and Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience in managing, securing, and optimizing Linux-based systems and cloud infrastructure. I have 6+ years of experience working with enterprise Linux systems, AWS & Azure cloud platforms, automation, monitoring, and security. I specialize in maintaining highly available environments, automating routine operations, and ensuring system reliability across development, testing, and production workloads.
      My expertise includes Linux system administration, cloud platforms, server monitoring, performance tuning, and incident troubleshooting. I have worked extensively with virtualization, containerized environments, and CI/CD-driven deployments, enabling scalable and cost-effective solutions.
      I am passionate about automation, reliability, and continuous improvement, and I thrive in environments where stability and innovation go hand in hand. My goal is to design and support infrastructure that is secure, resilient, and aligned with business needs.
